## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

### 2. Run Locally

You need to serve the files using a local web server for full functionality (especially for microphone access).

**With Python 3:**
```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
Open [http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html) in your browser.

```sh
npx serve .
```

- The bot sends user questions to an n8n webhook.

```js
const WEBHOOK_URL = "https://your-n8n-instance/webhook/your-webhook-id";
```

## üì± Browser Support
